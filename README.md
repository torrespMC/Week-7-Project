Optimization of finPrimes python code
The initial finPrimes code checks an integer to see if it is a prime number using a nested loop.
The second version uses one for loop and tests if the number modulo divided by the iteration equals zero.
If modulo division equals zero, then it is divisible by another number other than itself and 1.
